# Cali-Bud Delivery: Blog & Cornerstone Content Strategy

To dominate local search, the site must move beyond "Menu Pages" and establish **Intent Ownership** through cornerstone pillars and lifestyle guides.

## 1. The Cornerstone Pillars (The "God" Articles)
Identify 3-5 massive guides that establish the brand as THE authority in the niche/location.
- **Example**: "The Ultimate Guide to Ordering Weed in Antelope Valley (Legal & Fast)"
- **Example**: "Sativa, Indica, or Hybrid? Formatting Your Perfect High."
- **Goal**: 2,000+ words, internal links to EVERY menu category, and external links to compliance resources.

## 2. Project Spotlights (Strain Reviews / Delivery Stories)
For every top-shelf drop or happy customer story, create a "Proof of Quality" post.
- **Components**:
    - **The Product**: (e.g., "New Drop: Blue Dream Top Shelf")
    - **The Experience**: "Smooth, energetic, perfect for hiking Quartz Hill."
    - **The Visuals**: (High-res Macro WebP images)
    - **The Locality**: "Delivered in 45 mins to West Palmdale."

## 3. PAA Cluster Posts (Search Volume Capture)
Use the "People Also Ask" questions from [SEO_ROADMAP.md](SEO_ROADMAP.md) to create short-form (500-800 word) value posts.
- **Topic**: "Is weed delivery legal in Lancaster?"
- **Topic**: "How much do edibles cost in Palmdale?"
